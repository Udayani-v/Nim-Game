# Nim-Game
Nim is the two-player algorithm game! The basic rules for this game are as follows:

- The game starts with n  piles of stones indexed from 0 to n-1 . Each pile i (where 0<=i<n) has si  stones.
- The players move in alternating turns, with First always playing first and Second always playing second. 
  During each move, the current player must remove one or more stones from a single pile.
- The first player who is unable to remove a stone (e.g., a stone can't be removed if all piles are already empty) loses the game.

Given the value of n and the number of stones in each pile, determine the game's winner if both players play optimally.
